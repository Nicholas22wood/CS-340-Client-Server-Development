How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to first have a database to store all the information to make sure it is maintained and then have a CRUD program to read the database, update and delete the database, and create a database. Having the database also allows you to create queries that allow the user to easily access the information they want. The advantage of having it this way is that updating or altering the information is much easier and does not require as much work. I noticed that this can be used for many industries that sell products online and helping the customer search for a specific product.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist the way I approach a problem is by laying out the requirements that are needed and an outline of how to approach the problem. With this course I had to change my approach as this project requires a lot of fine detail and commands that need to be exact otherwise the program would not work, and the requirements not as clearly defined. To change my approach in the future I would get more information from the client as I had little information about the type of queries.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist to me connect the mechanical world to the computer world. When learning about engineering it seemed that the mechanical side such as cars where close to peak but the computer science side was not, and this is seen very well with Tesla as they have developed a user interface that is much better than any other car company. This is also seen on aircraft and spacecraft; they use a lot more software than they used to and many of them have developed so they can pilot and land themselves. From what I learned from this project I think the skills would be helpful for companies that need organization when it comes to searches. I think of vacation websites, or any realtor website, this would be very useful and used often.
